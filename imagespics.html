                                <p>At the end of each school term, the school organizes a field trip,
                                    you can add photos of your time during it. Such as the scenery, and photos with you and friends. For example, in my own scrapbook, my field trip was at Bird Paradise,
                                    the new bird park in Singapore. Most of my photos are with friends, but there are also some of my favourite animals in the page too. On the sides of the pages, I wrote my 
                                    expectations and experience during the field trip, as well as how grateful I am to be able to join and meet new people. While making this page, I was happy with
                                    the outcome, and how I will feel in the future looking back on these pages. This page is made by sticker paper.

                                    <p>You can also scrapbook you and your friends' hangouts. In mine, me and my friend went to Haji Lane to hangout and right afterwards, I hanged out with my parents. I 
                                        placed my favourite pictures of the day, and some decorations around. I had a lot of fun doing this; this page is plastered with glue and normal printing paper. You can 
                                        choose to see which one you like the most!

                                    <p>The vacations and travels of the year. Add your header as the country that you travelled to, and your favourite photos of the whole
                                        trip. This may be hard if you love to take a ton of photos everytime you go outside, but it's still worth it to see the work you placed 
                                        into your scrapbook. You can also place your airplane tickets for you to remember which seat you were on in plane. I like to do this because I 
                                        don't travel a lot.
